# PlayFab Banning Through Discord

Alrighty, download it obviously and then all you gotta do is make a .env file and grab your Discord Bot Token and make a variable named "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN" in your .env file. Grab your Title ID. It should be in your URL so "developer.playfab.com/en-US/AB123/dashboard" where the AB123 is you Title ID. In your .env file make the variable "PLAYFAB_TITLE_ID"
Get your developer secret (search it up for this one I can't remember off the top of my head) then place it in the .env file with the variable "PLAYFAB_SECRET_KEY". 

Now, make sure you get all the requirements. These will be "Discord", "Playfab" & "python-dotenv" and boom! You're done. Just run the file!
